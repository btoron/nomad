Hello {{ person.name }},

Unfortunately, the carpool at {{ carpool.leave_time | humanize }} from {{ carpool.from_place }} to {{ destination.name }} has been cancelled because the volunteer event has been cancelled or postponed.

{% if person.id == carpool.driver_id %}
You are the driver of that carpool.
{% endif %}

Please contact the campaign for more information.

Your volunteer help is still needed! To help another campaign by being a driver to an event, please visit {{ url_for('carpool.find', _external=True) }}

Thank you,

{{ config.get('BRANDING_EMAIL_SIGNATURE') }}
