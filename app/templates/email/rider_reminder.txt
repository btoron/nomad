Hi {{ rider.name }}!

Thank you for carpooling to canvass
Pickup: {{ carpool.from_place }}
Destination Name: {{ carpool.destination.name }}
Destination Address: {{ carpool.destination.address }}

Your carpool's departure time is {{ carpool.leave_time | humanize }}, only two days away!

Make sure you have spoken to your driver {{ carpool.driver.name }} to confirm your ride and settle all the details of pickup and drop-off. Your driver's email is {{ carpool.driver.email }} and their phone number is {{ carpool.driver.phone_number }} ({{ carpool.driver.preferred_contact_method }} preferred).

You can go to {{ url_for('carpool.details', uuid=carpool.uuid, _external=True) }} if you need to withdraw from the carpool. If you do withdraw, please try to do so early enough that other volunteers get a chance to join the carpool and the driver can make any changes they need to.

You are doing great work, thank you for joining us!
